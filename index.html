            Statement
          </h1>

          <p>
            In 2019, I visited a lunchtime lecture about making a typeface. The
            lecturer introduced his ‘brand-new’ typeface, which is a revival of
            historical drawings. As I’ve designed typefaces, I had questions
            about how he dealt with license issues of the original drawing in
            his country. He kindly answered my questions and said “Every type
            designer is a thief.” As a type designer, this has strongly stuck
            with me. I questioned myself. Would it be called theft if I sneak
            around handwriting, lettering, or open-source fonts to sketch my
            typeface and get inspiration from their shapes at some point? At
            what moment would the theft occur? I believe I’m not a thief, but on
            second thought, now I’m not so sure. <br /><br />

            <i>I might be a thief.</i> I peer into font files and compare them
            with my typeface to figure out how I can make mine different from
            others. As I continue this process, I get used to typefaces designed
            by others, remember the shapes, and internalize them. I might
            unconsciously use this memory when I create a new typeface. The
            borders between my original sketch and other designs get blurry. Do
            I affirm that this is not theft? Drawing from internalized memory
            seems in the spectrum of stealing. Copyright license aims to protect
            digital contents from piracy, but honestly who cares? Who is
            actually monitoring or tracking people stealing a font file?
            Persistent theft has loosed my morals and conscience. In the
            meantime, I found a fair way of stealing. Unlike copyright, the
            copyleft license allows people to copy and modify font files. So I
            downloaded an open-source typeface, UniFont, customized it, and
            created the new typeface, Pirata Mono. Under the copyleft, theft is
            fair play and even encouraged. I was excited that I found the way of
            not feeling guilty about stealing other typefaces. And the innocent
            stealing was the seed of something new.<br /><br />

            <i>I have to say I am a thief.</i> I keep stealing licensed e-books,
            images, and all kinds of metadata. I press command c and v, or
            right-click images to download. Digital theft has become
            indispensable and even rampant in my digital labor. But I realize
            what I’ve stolen is not the materials, but someone else’s labor. To
            steal the shape of the letter “S” in MetaFont, it takes seconds and
            is just too easy to hijack millions hours of digital labor by Donald
            Knuth. The convenient stealing makes the value of digital labor
            trifling and, moreover, unknowable. The digital Labor Recorder that
            I’ve created captures the unrepresented digital labor and reveals it
            in real-time. <br /><br />

            Sometimes I should’ve stolen something from me. Sound has been an
            annoying subject to me. When Paul Elliman asked me what music I
            like, I couldn’t answer because I don’t like listening to music. I
            had to create sound, but I knew nothing about sound. I came up with
            imaginary sound that I haven't ever heard. Something like the sound
            of metadata. I looked around the most familiar sound to copy. It was
            MY sound. In the sound of metadata, ‘The breathing’ or ‘When I’m
            thinking’ is the mimicked sound that I observed and replicated my
            habit of speaking and mumbling.<br /><br />
            </p>
              
          <p>
            I will be a thief. I first recognized myself as a thief when making
            typefaces, but theft has been complicated through experiencing
            graphic design, coding, and sound. Theft is crafty, enterprising and
            more than just stealing. The nature of theft is entangled with
            originality, value, labor, protection, substitution, quality, and
            branches out further like vines. By crossing over various
            disciplines, my practice are the exploration of how I perceive
            theft, why I steal, and how I exploit copied materials.<br /><br /><br /><br />

          <h1>Pirata</h1>

          <h2>Pirata</h2>

          <p>
            Typeface, 2020-21<br />
            Pirata Mono Light, Regular, Regular Italic, Regular Proportional<br /><br />

            Pirata Mono is a customized font based on Unifont. Pirata mono trial
            is under copyleft licensing, which is to give all user the freedom
            to download, customize, share the design free. For the mashers,
            modders, remakers who use digital cut-and-paste technologies,
            copyleft allows them to make something new from something old.
            Pirata Mono Trial has some missing characters represented ‘⟲’. But
            people use entire character set or won't be interrupted, if buy the
            full version.<br /><br /><br /><br />
          </p>

          <h2>Process</h2>
          <p>
            A font file is now the most vulnerable digital material to theft.
            This is because the file is unencrypted, allowing people to copy
            accurate coordinate values of shapes and typography information. As
            I acknowledge the weakness of the protection, I’ve tried not to
            copy, share or modify font files made by other designers when using
            fonts. When making fonts, however, there are times when I inevitably
            open other font files and check coordinate values of shapes.
            <br /><br />

            I peer into multiple typefaces which look similar to my typeface and
            compare them with my design to find out how I can make mine more
            characteristic and different from others. As the comparison
            continues, I get used to the shapes designed by others, remember the
            shapes, and internalize them. In this process, this memory can be
            unconsciously withdrawn when I create a new typeface, and the
            borders between my original sketch and other designs get blurry. Do
            I affirm this is not theft? It seems that drawing from internalized
            memory is kind of in the spectrum of stealing. We know that
            copyright license aims to protect digital contents from piracy, but
            honestly who cares? Who is actually monitoring or tracking people
            stealing a font file?
            <br /><br />

            In the meantime, I found the fair way of stealing in type design.
            The legal and innocent stealing is possible under the ‘copyleft’
            license.<small>[1]</small>
            The concept of the copyleft is ‘all wrongs reserved’. Unlike
            copyright, users can freely steal digital contents and shake-up or
            troll them under the copyleft. Maybe the original contents must get
            washed away while modifications, but it can be the way of creating a
            new contents from old ones. In this internet free culture, the
            copyleft is originated from the belief that openness and
            collaboration can generate more qualified software, rather than
            preserving the original data or forbidding piracy. In this copyleft
            scenario, type designers can fairly steal ideas or shapes to make a
            new typeface.
            <br /><br />

            Pirata<small>[2]</small> is the typeface under copyleft that anyone
            can download, customize the design, and share for free. Unlike most
            trial fonts, any modifications, shake-ups, or trolling are allowed
            as well as selling others the secondary works. While copyright
            prohibits sharing and modification of digital contents, copyleft
            license is originated from the belief that transparency, openness,
            and publicity can generate more qualified software, revitalizing the
            software market. Not only for users, copyleft can be a breakthrough
            for some type designers who want to be free from the pressure of
            protecting their design. Although the originality gets washed away
            through modifying under copyleft, that would be another opportunity
            to remember the original shape of contents, and the original
            creator’s name can be recorded into the credit of modified content.
            <br /><br />
          </p>
          <p>
            In this context, Pirata is the manifesto of stealing as protection
            against copyright license policy. Pirata is modified from the pixel
            font, Unifont, which is an open-source font and had been widely used
            by embedding to freeware software in the '90s. Like other trial
            fonts, Pirata Mono has missing characters, ‘C, O, P, Y, L, E, F, T’,
            and the shape of missing characters are substituted by the logo of
            copyleft. In ‘piratamonotrial.download’, Pirata Mono Trial’s online
            showcase, users can test and download it. Following the copyleft
            manifesto, the concept of the website was inspired by the interface
            of old font-making programs.
            <br /><br />

            Additionally, I offer the full version of Pirata Mono for users who
            simply want to use the font to their design instead of modifying the
            shape. In the full version, it has all characters like numerals or
            symbols to function as a practical typeface. Now I'm adding more
            typeface families such as Pirata Mono Italic, Pirata Mono Light, and
            Pirata Regular and plan to support multi- languages like Cyrillic,
            Greek, and Korean.
            <br /><br />

            Pirata Mono will follow the spirit of copyleft.
            <a href="www.trialfontexpert.com">Trialfontexpert.com</a>
            triggered me to suss out the problematic point of protecting
            typeface within copyright and was a driving force to make Pirata and
            <a href="www.piratamonotrial.download">piratamonotrial.download</a>.
            As Unifont allowed me to ‘steal’ it, Pirata Mono is a configurable
            typeface, allowing users to utilize it without constraints by
            piracy. Especially in type design area, this practice is expected to
            be the discourse of how fair use of stealing can be the protection
            by a typeface designer.

          <h1>Trial Font Archive</h1>

          <h2>Trial Font Archive</h2>

          <p>
            Research, website, 2020<br />
            trialfontexpert.com<br /><br />

            This is a website that has a name list of trial fonts over 3,400 and
            their terms of use. As a trial font is a demo of its full version,
            everyone can download it for free. Type foundries have promoted
            their typeface by offering trial fonts, and users have downloaded
            them to test directly to designs before users buy the full version.
            As I haven’t seen or offered a trial font in Korea, a trial font is
            such a curiosity and challenging material in terms of protecting
            design. To find out the license condition of various trial fonts,
            I’ve downloaded trial files and their Terms of Use as many as
            possible.<br /><br /><br /><br />
          </p>

          <h2>
            Process
          </h2>
          <p>
            The concept of trialfontexpert.com is an encyclopedia that archives
            vast information of trial fonts in a single webpage. Especially on
            the collection of terms of use page, core contents are highlighted
            and quickly viewed with navigators. The webpage reminds font users
            how common trial fonts are and both the file and design are
            unprotected from theft. Trial fonts are hard to get free from theft
            no matter how hard type designers protect them. It’s because that
            the files don’t automatically expire and have no additional
            technology that can force users to stop using the files. Especially
            in the part of sharing, copying, and modifying in Terms of Use
            written by many type foundries, type foundry appeals to the user’s
            conscience. The more problematic is that every type foundries has
            slightly different or ambiguous licensing policies. But honestly,
            who cares about the Terms of Use? Even I have never written or read
            Terms of Use for my typefaces.<br /><br />

            Despite the constant threat from theft, a trial font has the minimal
            protection planted by the type designer. It’s called
            <i>‘missing characters.’</i> Unlike a full version, a trial font
            often has only lowercase and uppercase and doesn’t contain numerals,
            symbols, which can reduce the risk of exposing the entire design in
            the first place. In trialfontexpert.com, all texts are set by the
            trial font, Monument Grotesk Semi-mono Trial by Dinamo, and many
            characters are missing and are replaced by question marks (�). Each
            missing character can be any shape other than question marks, so a
            typeface designer can actively utilize the missing characters as
            design components when drawing the forms. That being said a designer
            can decide how much or how to protect the font design, at least in
            making a trial font. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

            Digital Labor Recorder

            Digital Labor Recorder tracks all keyboard events that appear during
            digital labor in real time. The purpose of digital labor is to make
            digital materials (for example, jpg or pdf files), using digital
            devices. Unlike physical labor, digital labor can be done in any
            location, without time constraints. But it remains unknown who is
            working beyond the screen and how much time and effort they are
            exerting. For example, we barely witness the evidence of labor for
            type design, one of the most time-consuming digital labor processes.
            Similarly, a font file can be shown as flat and partial metadata and
            fails to represent the process.<br /><br />

            At the keyboard, a digital worker’s hands and tools physically and
            constantly meet to render digital materials. Through this website,
            we can see the process of digital labor through the tying of keys on
            the keyboard that is constantly updated in real time, and the log is
            recorded as evidence of digital labor even after the work is
            finished. Although recorded key events are still seemingly
            fragmentary metadata, this website allows one to witness digital
            labor and would be a starting point to think about how to detect the
            unknowable process of digital labor.<br /><br /><br /><br />
          </p>

          <h2>
            Process
          </h2>

          <p>
            As there was much time to stay at home and work due to COVID-19,
            I’ve been working on designing Hangul (Korean letter system)
            typeface over summer break. When making one character, I saw there
            are 255 nodes and points to be adjusted for one single glyph. Hangul
            has 11,172 characters in total, which implies that I have to refine
            millions of nodes and points and it takes approximately one or two
            years to be published. After nine month I finally generated the
            font, and the file was 323KB. As a font file is a digital product, I
            can set the price to sell it but haven’t decided how much yet.
            Considering the average font price in a market, my font would be
            $35-65. But some questions arise. Does the digital material
            described as 323KB and $50 represent the thousands hours of my
            digital labor? How are people aware of the value of my digital labor
            on making the font? More fundamentally, what is the value of digital
            material? As Marx said, labor process is value-making process.
            Perhaps it’s helpful to know digital labor process to detect the
            value of digital materials. <br /><br />

            Donald Knuth, a computer scientist and a professor at Stanford
            University, made a MetaFont in 1970s. Because Knuth was an outsider
            of graphic industry, he calculated all the shapes of letters in
            mathmetic way and constructed it by coding. While making MetaFont,
            he mentioned about the difficulty of making the letter ’S’ in
            interviews. Additionally, the frustration of making ’S’ can be seen
            on his work journals. Knuth wrote one journal on Jun 30 1970, and it
            says “Up late Wednesday, tried again. For eight hours to finish the
            letter ’S’. Not feeling very good, will not go onto this kind of
            goofy schedule any more.” After he finished making MetaFont, he
            wrote a paper, ‘The Letter S’. It describes how he constructed the
            shape and the detailed making-process. The external ‘S’ seems just
            flat dry metadata. However through the additional record like
            interviews, journals and the paper, I could re-recognize the value
            of S-looking like graphic and empathize eight hours’ digital labor
            by Knuth. Digital workers are unseen, but digital labor process is
            describable and representable. <br /><br />

            But have you ever “witnessed” someone doing digital labor? Recently
            people have streamed in real time what they are doing and how they
            work on Youtube and Instagram. Does real-time streaming make their
            outcomes more special? Or do people expect another rewards or
            compensation for their digital labor? <br /><br />

            Think about the simplest type of digital labor, I email people, read
            e-books, and write my thoughts to you from Korea remotely. Digital
            labor is easy and convenient to do. I even don’t need to say
            something out load. All I need to do is just to press a keyboard,
            siting on a chair. In contrast, the moment of digital labor is
            unknownable. Digital workers are always beyond the screen, and only
            witnesser of labor process is the digital worker themselves.

            Meanwhile, digital tools have recorded my labor in real time. At
            keyboard, my hands and digital tool meet and interact constantly.
            Keys are pressed and released. They are delivering my inputs,
            dematerializing my physical labor. And dematerialized input logs are
            re-recorded as written texts at the bottom of this website. Like
            Donald Knuth’s journals and paper are seemingly the clue for
            picturing his digital labor process, the recorded keyboard events at
            the bottom of this website would be the evidence of my digital labor
            process. The keyboard events history that you and I just saw could
            be the partial record of my 3-minute-digital labor. But the record
            is limited to show the movement of a digital tool. The text still
            has no capacity to represent who was the digital worker and how the
            worker was ‘moving’ around. A digital worker’s eyes, hands motion,
            and sound are still unrepresented. If some records of digital labor
            process are lacking of humanity, how I determine the digital labor
            is rendered by me or AI? In the world that AI and human work
            together, I keep detecting the digital labor process rendered by
            human, which is the value-making process.<br /><br />

            A web cam is another digital tool that captures someone’s physical
            movement. Due to pandemic, I’ve been using a web cam a lot and often
            more than before. Especially on Zoom we can see people moving around
            our faces, flickering eyes, or waiving hands. Speaking of Zoom’s
            meeting room interface, it’s quite awkward and annoying that I can
            see my own face as well. A web cam is capturing my own physical
            motion that even I haven’t noticed. Camera, real time body movement,
            and digital labor. A webcam is likely to punctuate like a motion
            capture device. If a webcam can track face and hand movements, it
            might be a new tool to detect a digital labor process. By using a
            webcam and some coding, I created a secondary digital labor
            detector. I visited a new digital labor detector, access microphone
            and camera. And then it’s all set to detect digital labor. When I’m
            trying to draw a typeface, I witnessed my eye’s flickering, turning
            my head around, mouse clicking sounds, fingers motions, and heart
            rate at once. After a few minutes digital labor, I got the letter
            ‘s’. But I got all the labor sceneries that my web cam had captured.
            With is detector, the ‘S’ rendered on the workplace is not the only
            product of this digital labor. All scenes re bi-products and remain
            as the animated evidence of making the letter ‘S’.<br /><br /><br /><br />

          </h2>

          <p>
            Digital book, 2019<br />
            138 x 210 x 20mm<br /><br />

            The looking of a left hand is the symmetry of a right hand, but a
            left hand has been differentiated in symbolic, religious, and
            historical ways. In some contexts, a left hand is treated as an
            unjust, prejudicial distinction, or feminine. while a right hand
            means something right, origin, or masculine. From the perspective of
            a left-handed, this book follows what a left hand distinguishes a
            right hand, and how a left hand and a right hand reflect each other
            in many different cultures.<br /><br />

            The book has fourteen texts, from three different books, The New
            Ambidextrous Universe by Martin Gardner, Right & left; essays on
            dual symbolic classification by Rodney Needham, and The Right Hand:
            Left-Handedness by Daniel Wilson. For the design part, all body
            texts are placed on the left-handed pages. On the left-handed pages,
            there are some keywords flipped from left-handed pages so that two
            pages mirror and show each other.<br /><br /><br /><br />
